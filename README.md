##[UGA Big Data Consulting Services and Training Center](https://research.franklin.uga.edu/bigdata/)


**"Welcome to the Big Data Consulting Services and Training center at the University of Georgia.**

The goal of this center is to provide faculty and students with basic consultation and training services in order to help them more efficiently meet their data collection, processing, storage, access, sharing, curation, and publication needs.


**This center will focus on three areas:**

1. The use of high performance computing
2. Data management
3. Cross-disciplinary coordination


We will develop a set of web resources that can serve as both a central resource for the campus and a starting point for further efforts to enhance UGAâ€™s cyberinfrastruture capabilities.

Finally, we will continue to conduct the popular university-wide "Big Data" events under the auspices of the center to aid in communicating, coordinating, and disseminating activity around data-intensive research."
